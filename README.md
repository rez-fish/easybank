# Easybank
Hello!

I created this Easybank website with the help of the designers at https://www.frontendmentor.io/. This is a really cool website that gives you assets to download so you do not have to come up with a design yourself and you can focus on developmenet. 

This site emulates real life work flow. They give you images, text, colors and the Adobe XD file so you can develop a page that matches the design perfectly.

This was alot of fun and I am happy to be able to be able to work on my skills.

You can check out what the website looks like here -> https://rez-fish.github.io/easybank/

What I Used 
________

I made different SCSS files for each portion of the web page.
I used the BEM architeecture for easy orginization. 
The page was made in basic HTML/SCSS/JS.

I developed the project with a Mobile First Design.

This website is responsive.

Thank you for checking out my work.
